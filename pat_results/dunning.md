# Dunning-Krueger analisys

## OVERESTIMATION OF COMPETENCE  

- Believing childhood trauma defines social worth, ignoring true individuality.  
- Assuming diverse job roles equate to expertise in all technical fields.  
- Overvaluing past projects (e.g., Diablo 2 UI) as career credentials.  
- Thinking personal struggles (drugs, social anxiety) are easily managed.  
- Confidently claiming unique profile as a field engineer without mastery.  
- Overestimating AI's ability to replace foundational coding knowledge.  
- Believing job failures are due to external factors, not skill gaps.  
- Assuming mining experience translates to ERP implementation fluency.  
- Overlooking the need for structured learning in specific technologies.  
- Thinking opinions on workplace issues are justified despite past consequences.  

## UNDERESTIMATION OF COMPETENCE  

- Underestimating the value of formal education in administration.  
- Minimizing the impact of social anxiety on professional collaboration.  
- Discounting the need for consistent coding practice over time.  
- Underestimating the complexity of ERP systems like Odoo.  
- Neglecting the role of emotional intelligence in leadership.  
- Underestimating the long-term effects of substance abuse.  
- Undervaluing the importance of version control and modern frameworks.  
- Underestimating the need for self-advocacy in career transitions.  
- Discounting the significance of trauma-informed decision-making.  
- Underestimating the potential of AI as a tool, not a replacement.  

## METACOGNITIVE SKILLS  

- Struggles to reflect on past failures as learning opportunities.  
- Cannot accurately assess coding proficiency without external validation.  
- Fails to recognize the gap between diverse experience and technical mastery.  
- Overlooks the need for incremental goal-setting in skill development.  
- Underestimates the role of self-discipline in overcoming addiction.  
- Misjudges the value of social interactions in professional settings.  
- Cannot evaluate the effectiveness of self-taught methods objectively.  
- Overlooks the importance of feedback in improving technical work.  
- Struggles to balance subjective confidence with objective skill gaps.  
- Underestimates the time required to build expertise in ERP systems.  

## IMPACT ON DECISION MAKING  

- Relying on impulsive decisions to avoid emotional discomfort.  
- Chasing IT careers despite lacking foundational coding knowledge.  
- Discounting the necessity of structured learning due to past self-taught success.  
- Overestimating the ability to manage complex systems without training.  
- Letting trauma dictate career choices, ignoring alternative paths.  
- Underestimating the importance of networking in job searches.  
- Misjudging the value of opinions in workplace dynamics.  
- Failing to plan for financial stability due to overconfidence in income.  
- Letting short-term gratification (drugs, social avoidance) override long-term goals.  
- Assuming diverse experience alone can compensate for technical skill gaps.  

The input ownerâ€™s journey reveals a paradoxical blend of overconfidence in their eclectic skill set and underestimation of the depth required in technical fields like coding and ERP implementation. Their belief in a "unique profile" masks a lack of mastery in specific areas, while trauma-driven decisions and social avoidance hinder systemic growth. To bridge these gaps, they must first acknowledge their overestimated tech competence and commit to structured learning, then recognize the value of collaboration and emotional regulation in both personal and professional contexts. By addressing these misalignments, they can transform their diverse experiences into a coherent, skill-based foundation for future success.
