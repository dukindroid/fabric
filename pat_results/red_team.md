# Red team

- Overestimating unique profile's marketability without concrete evidence or networking.  
- Assuming ERP/CRM adoption barriers are solely due to complexity, ignoring cost and training factors.  
- Confusing management expertise with technical coding skills, risking misalignment in mission.  
- Underestimating the emotional toll of past traumas on current decision-making and focus.  

- Address trauma by seeking therapy to process separation from family and its impact on motivation.  
- Validate ERP/CRM opportunities through case studies, not just personal assumptions.  
- Build savings incrementally with side projects, not relying on a single goal for financial stability.  
- Develop structured routines for quitting drugs and exercise, avoiding vague "start small" approaches.
