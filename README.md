# Fabric Project Overview

This project explores the capabilities of the **Fabric** tool through the implementation of a [custom Telos prompt](https://github.com/danielmiessler/Telos). The core reference file is [telos.md](telos.md), which contains the foundational prompts and configurations. Outputs from Fabric pattern analysis are stored in the [pat_results](pat_results/) directory.

## Directory Structure

- **memory_bank/**: Contains memory files generated by the Cline tool, including:
  - `projectbrief.md`: Describes the project's purpose and requirements.
  - `README.md`: Initial documentation for the memory bank directory.
- **pat_results/**: Stores results from Fabric's pattern analysis.
- **myblog/**: Likely contains blog-related content (structure to be defined).
- **mcp-servers/**: MCP server configurations (currently empty).
- **.gitignore**: Standard Git ignore file.
- **cline_mcp_settings.json**: Configuration for Cline's MCP tool integration.
- **unique_patterns.txt**: Text file for storing unique pattern identifiers.

## Key Files
- `telos.md`: Central to the project's prompt customization.
- `projectbrief.md`: Explains the project's goals and dependencies.
- `unique_patterns.txt`: Tracks patterns analyzed by Fabric.

## Technologies
- **Cline**: Memory and pattern analysis tool.
- **Fabric**: Pattern recognition and analysis framework.
- **Telos**: Custom prompt implementation reference.
