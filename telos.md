# TELOS

## DOCUMENT PURPOSE

This document captures the TELOS method of articulating a person's personal context so that they, and AI, can better understand them and help them improve. Pay attention to the items and the concepts here, and especially on how they work together.

The conceptual path is Problems -> Mission -> (Narratives) -> Goals -> Challenges -> Strategies —> Projects -> Journal. This means that any project you're doing can be mapped all the way back up to the problem(s) you're trying to solve. This gives you transparency and explainability in everything you're doing so you don't end up busy for days/months/years without being able to remember why you're doing what you're doing.

Other sections that aren't those core sections are additional context to support them.

## HISTORY

- I was born february 3, 1983, at Guadalajara, Jalisco, México, first son of a medium class family with a father making a living on radio networtking and computers and a school teacher mother.
- At an early age (3 years old) I needed an skin removal surgery, to remove a carcinogenous mole in my arm. This let me traumatized for about three years, in which I was unable to bear the presence of scissors. Then, through my childhood, I remember this trait (the scar in my arm) as a focus point for other kids to bully me, or make stand apart, so apparently I decided to stand aside from big groups of socialization in order to keep safe. Many years later, as an adult 33 years old, I understood that this was a false idea implanted by myself, as most of the time scars are not a characteristic that makes people unwanted or bullied, on the contrary, it gives them individuality, sets them apart.
- At age 6, my family moved to Colima, Colima, México. I've been living mostly here since then.
- Always attended private schools, and had perfect scores through all of elementary school.
- Kind of an antisocial type, never had more than one close friend at a time, and always found difficulty in participating in discussions with groups larger than three people.
- People always labeled me as a "kid genius" for the things that i were capable of in computer matters. At the age of 10 I pretty much had a working notion on how to navigate a DOS system.
- Saw Windows evolve from the 3.0 version to its last installment Windows 11.
- Also I lived through the evolution of the internet from telephone lines and old modems to current fiber optic networks and 5G.
- Trough my great scores at elementary school, I attained a scholarship for high school on a really spensive school: "Prepa Tec", a subsidiary of ITESM.
- Through highschool I mantained my attitude of solitary, few friends, quiet smart dude.
- In highschool my dad bought me my first personal computer, a Thinkpad series laptop. I still keep nostalgic memories from that laptop, as I discored mp3's, irc, msn chat, and many popular games from this era (starcraft, age of empires, half-life, quake, diablo 2)
- I became popular from copying the diablo 2 UI using macromedia dreamweaver and flash for a computer science proyect.
- Even when I didn't had perfect scores at this high school as I was used to, I won a prestigious schoralship to which what I considered the best option for education and my future. An engineering degree at the ITESM (Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey).
- Even with the scholarship, my family was unable to cover the expenses of this school, so instead I began an engineering degree in computer systems at a public school, the "Tecnológico de Colima".
- I became really frustrated with this stage of my student life. I didn't understood my friends, the teachers, the system as a whole in this school was not whay I was used to in my previous educational institution. Perceiving it's quality as "lower", I started again the process of attaining an even higher tuition for a scholarship of my previous wanted option.
- Finally, after almost three years on the engineering degree, I changed schools, and started the computer systems engineering degree again with the option I initially wanted.
- I had to travel to the city of Monterrey to continue with the degree, as it was not available at my hometown campus.
- This was a huge sacrifice for my mother, who paid most of my expenses throug this stage, including rent, food and the university costly montly payment.
- At monterrey, a close friend convinced me somehow to start working at a telemarketing bussiness. There I would met whom would be some of my best friends of all my life but also went stray from my original engineering degree priority.
- After a year working as a service representant for a cellphone company, I lost my scholarship due to low grades, after I took the egregious decisition of changing majors. I started a degree on electric systems, letting aside computers. My internal motivation was that I wanted to go further deep in the know-how of computers
- This proved to be an error as my knowledge of phisics was deficient and really needed in this other major
- I stayed at Monterrey around two more years not studying or responsibly working, but just ping-ponging from one friend house to another, not wanting to come back to Colima, as I didn't want to confront my mother for losing my scholarship and all the hardships that she went for lost in as well
- There I had my first coding job, at a digital signage company. There I learned to use sim card modems to send automatic SMS through a windows UI written in Visual Basic Studio.
- Finally after getting a severe case of apendicitys (most probably caused by an excesive consumption rate of alcohol) another friend returned me against my will to my home town.
- Battling with the change of city, losing friends, my dreams and losing all credibility with my family, I started working with my mom, as a cashier, bought a house, and after many years out of school, started in 2013 again what I left in Monterrey, but in a really cheaper option. My current school, the ICEP.
- There again, the social pressure from my schoolmates became unbearable and I ended having a non expected child. As I procured ginecologist services and anticonceptives to my girlfriend, I became jaded and didn't recognized the baby. Just gave her her first name 'Aurora' and she was born on december 10, 2014, but never authorized my surname, as I had suspitions of my girlfriend having an affair with a past friend of hers.
- To pay for my school I started working as a jewerly dealer, one of my more deeply cherished jobs, as it made me grow giant leaps as a person. In this job I learned to drive, to treat with unknown people, and even when I had a severe marihuana abuse problem, somehow I managed with my life
- After four years finally I became a certified Computer Systems Engineer in the year 2016.
- I worked for the ICEP just after graduating as a systems assistant, monitoring the school network and trying to help my boss maintain or renew the ICEP's CRM that would become an impossible mission
- My boss here was reluctant to adapt to new programming paradigms and was adamant on using uncommented and undocumented PHP spaghetti code
- Here I started learning javascript, express, next, and how to properly maintain a git repository and a versioning system. My boss never liked the results I had, as he didn't wanted to have anything to do with javascript.
- Losing hope, I stopped helping with coding, and was relegated to writing just SQL queries to make new reports for the administratives of the school
- Finally I lost my nerve, became frustrated of having a coding job and not being able to code, and left this job in anger.
- My suspcitions of my now ex-girlfriend having another partner weren't unfounded, the other guy gave my daughter his surname, but anyways, I forgave my ex and we moved in together to my just bought new home
- We lived together for four years, and the situation became unbearable mostly because of her lazyness and my addictions.
- She decided to move back with her mom and I obtained a job at Manzanillo as an IT assistant looking for the network of the company where I worked with my mom as a cashier.
- This didn't last, as I had begun a meth addiction that made me perform poorly in my job. High stress, long hours and no sleep made me throw the towel. The fact that I had to cover around 36 POS locations in all of Manzanillo without a car or passage expenses didn't help
- Again, had to fall back with working with my mom as a cashier.
- COVID became a thing, and around this time I decide to take a bootcamp course about Javascript.
- After months hunting jobs, I get one as a frontend developer in CDMX
- I fail miserably after only three weeks, because my weak knoledge of react wasn't enough to cover the highly advanced projects this company had. I never stood a chance.
- Deeply dissapointed, I return to Colima, and as a quick option I start working as a gas station clerk.
- After one year in the gas station, an old friend from hischool invites me to work in his mining company, as a warehouseman.
- After many dissapointments with my original IT career I decide to let it aside and embrace whatever god has to send me about.
- This proves to be the right attitude, as I become versed on welding, diesel motors, heavy machinery, and many other topics that just seemed so far to me just years ago.
- This job becomes the most satisfactory and well paid job I never had before.
- I continue coding as a hobby, with the esp32 microcontroller, and with the Odoo ERP platform, trying to use it to manage my warehouse inventory.
- After one year and four months this friend fires me after I state publicly that his mining company is not serious. He takes this as a direct atack to his ego and after all that my laboral experience I should know better when to keep my mouth shut. But I didn't. He fires me and now we are here writing a Telos file.
- As a final pointer, my [last used CV](/Resume-Javier-Gutiérrez-Herrera.pdf) was adjoined to this repository.

- Last christmas (2024), I visited my ex and had such a disagreement that my gut made a sommersault and I ended at an ER with the worst inguinal pain I've felt in my life, as a result of an hernial incarceration. Because of this, I decided to leave my ex (and my ten old daughter and his little three years brother) to their luck. As painful as it is, I recognize that I will be unable to change her ways, and that will destroy me, phisically and emotionally.
- Losing my expensive carrer at the ITESM
- Being fired from a frontend position just three weeks on the job.
- Being fired for arguing or disagreeing publicly with my boss.
